Koch method Morse code trainer
==============================

Command line `Koch method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Learning_methods>`_ 
Morse code audio generation and training program.

Implements:

- Morse code audio playback and file generation
- with configurable `Farnsworth timing [PDF] <http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/x9004008.pdf>`_
  (defaults to a minimum of 20 WPM characters at any WPM less than 20 WPM)
- and filters to limit the code's audio bandwith
- supporting a 
  `Koch method <http://web.archive.org/web/20130208133414/http://www.codepractice.com/learning.html>`_
  CLI training program

Installation
------------

Requires:

- `audiogen <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/audiogen>`_ 
- `PyAudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/>`_ for audio playback (as opposed to file generation) 

Tested with Python 2.7.9 on Mac OS X.

Install with::

    $ pip install koch

Note that to install the PyAudio dependency on Mac OS X, you'll need to first
install `portaudio` with Homebrew::

    $ brew install portaudio

Examples
--------

Play back strings in Morse by passing them as command line arguments::

    $ koch hello world

Save the generated code to a WAV file::

    $ koch -f hello.wav hello world

Change the code speed from the default 20 WPM to 30 WPM::

    $ koch -c 30 hello world

And the tone frequency from the default 770 Hz to 440 Hz::

    $ koch -H 440 hello world

Try a slower speed, which will default to Farnsworth timing with each character played
at 20 WPM (default) but the inter-character spacings slowed to 10 WPM::

    $ koch -w 10 hello world

Keep the inter-character speed at 10 WPM, but increase the Farnsworth character speed to 
30 WPM::

    $ koch -w 10 --cwpm 30 hello world

Start a Koch method training sequence, which begins by teaching only the letter 'K' 
(default 20 WPM, 10 characters generated per training run, random word lengths)::

    $ koch

Move up to learning the first two characters in the Koch method (i.e. 'K' and 'M')::

    $ koch -c 2

This will randomly play 10 'K' or 'M' characters in words of random lengths, then pause
and wait for the user to hit the <Enter> key before printing the actual test sequence
played. 

You can also try a custom Koch alphabet, e.g. to learn in a different character order::

    $ koch -a ABCDE -c 3


Several options together to generate a WAV file with a 30 WPM, 440 Hz Koch training session
that's 20 characters long teaching letters 'K,', 'M,' and 'R'::

    $ koch -w 30 -H 440 -c 20 -f koch.wav 

Get help with CLI options::

    $ koch -h

Version history
---------------

- 0.0.2 - Limit code audio bandwidth to 200 Hz using bandpass filters. Improved 
  file output behavior for easier scripting.
